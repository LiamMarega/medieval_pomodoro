# Step-by-Step Guide: Add LiveActivityManager.swift to Xcode Project

## üö® IMPORTANT: Fix the Build Error

The build is failing because `LiveActivityManager.swift` is not added to the Xcode project. Follow these steps to fix it:

## Step 1: Open Xcode Project
1. Xcode should already be open with `Runner.xcworkspace`
2. If not, run: `cd ios && open Runner.xcworkspace`

## Step 2: Add LiveActivityManager.swift to Project

### Option A: Drag and Drop Method (Recommended)
1. In Xcode's Project Navigator (left sidebar), find the **Runner** folder
2. Right-click on the **Runner** folder (not the project root)
3. Select **"Add Files to 'Runner'"**
4. Navigate to: `ios/Runner/LiveActivityManager.swift`
5. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure these options are checked:
   - ‚úÖ **"Add to target: Runner"** (this is crucial!)
   - ‚úÖ **"Copy items if needed"** (if not already in the project)
6. Click **"Add"**

### Option B: File Menu Method
1. In Xcode, go to **File ‚Üí Add Files to "Runner"**
2. Navigate to: `ios/Runner/LiveActivityManager.swift`
3. Ensure **"Add to target: Runner"** is checked
4. Click **"Add"**

## Step 3: Verify File is Added
1. In the Project Navigator, you should see `LiveActivityManager.swift` under the **Runner** folder
2. Click on the file to make sure it opens and shows the Swift code
3. The file should be highlighted in blue (indicating it's part of the target)

## Step 4: Check Target Membership
1. Select `LiveActivityManager.swift` in the Project Navigator
2. Open the **File Inspector** (right sidebar, first tab)
3. Under **"Target Membership"**, make sure **"Runner"** is checked
4. If not, check the box next to **"Runner"**

## Step 5: Verify Live Activities Capability
1. Select the **Runner** target (top of Project Navigator)
2. Go to **"Signing & Capabilities"** tab
3. Look for **"Live Activities"** capability
4. If not present, click **"+ Capability"** and add **"Live Activities"**

## Step 6: Uncomment the Code
After adding the file, uncomment the Live Activity calls in `AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift
// In AppDelegate.swift, uncomment these lines:

// DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1.0) {
//   startHelloWorldLiveActivity()
// }

// And in applicationDidBecomeActive:
// startHelloWorldLiveActivity()
```

## Step 7: Build and Test
1. Clean the build: **Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder**
2. Build the project: **Product ‚Üí Build**
3. Run on your device: **Product ‚Üí Run**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you still get "Cannot find 'startHelloWorldLiveActivity'" error:
1. **Check Target Membership**: Make sure `LiveActivityManager.swift` is added to the **Runner** target
2. **Clean Build**: Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder
3. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes Xcode needs a restart to recognize new files
4. **Check File Location**: Ensure the file is in the correct location: `ios/Runner/LiveActivityManager.swift`

### If the file doesn't appear in Xcode:
1. **Refresh Project Navigator**: Right-click in Project Navigator ‚Üí "Refresh"
2. **Check File Exists**: Verify `LiveActivityManager.swift` exists in the file system
3. **Re-add the file**: Try adding it again using the steps above

### If you get other build errors:
1. **Check iOS Deployment Target**: Make sure it's set to iOS 16.1 or higher
2. **Check Swift Version**: Ensure Swift version is 5.0 or higher
3. **Check Entitlements**: Verify `Runner.entitlements` has the correct app group

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

When everything is working correctly:
1. ‚úÖ `LiveActivityManager.swift` appears in Project Navigator under Runner
2. ‚úÖ File opens and shows Swift code when clicked
3. ‚úÖ Target Membership shows "Runner" is checked
4. ‚úÖ Build succeeds without errors
5. ‚úÖ App launches and Live Activity appears on device

## üéØ Expected Result

After completing these steps:
- The app will build successfully
- Live Activity will start automatically when the app launches
- You'll see the animated knight emoji (‚öîÔ∏è) in the Dynamic Island
- The Live Activity will show on the lock screen

## üì± Testing

Test on a physical device with:
- iPhone 14 Pro or newer (has Dynamic Island)
- iOS 16.1 or higher
- Live Activities enabled in device settings

The Live Activity should start automatically and show the medieval-themed animations!
